# Soybean Crush Monitor: A Geopolitical Asset Dashboard

**Live Dashboard:** [View Here](https://miguelariveracabezas.github.io/soybean-crush-dashboard/)

## The Thesis: 2026 Outlook
Soybeans are no longer just an agricultural commodity; they are a policy asset sitting at the intersection of:
* **Food Inflation:** Meal pricing and livestock feed costs.
* **Energy Policy:** Renewable diesel mandates (RFS volumes) and 45Z credits.
* **Geopolitics:** US-China trade flows and state-level purchasing behavior.

## What This Project Does
This dashboard visualizes the structural regime shifts in the CBOT Crush Spread. Instead of simple price tracking, it monitors:
1.  **Oil Share %:** The influence of energy policy on the complex.
2.  **Flow Composition:** Distinguishing between State (political) and Private (commercial) buying from China.
3.  **Regime Detection:** Rolling Z-Scores to flag volatility anomalies.

## Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, Tailwind CSS
* **Visualization:** Chart.js (Canvas rendering)
* **Data Structure:** JavaScript-based simulation of Fred/USDA/CME data points.
